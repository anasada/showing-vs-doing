# Extending Showing vs Doing

My goal with this project was to extend Mark Ho's "Showing vs Doing" paper. Thus, I began by attempting to recreate one of his experiment conditions, but did not fully complete this project.

## Description

A 5x5 grid with "Start" written in the middle square, "&" in the top-right, "%" in the bottom-left, and "#" in the bottom-right. The participant is given the goal of going to one of the symbols. They move between squares by using the arrow keys and a black line follows their movement. Upon reaching their goal, they are congratulated, but the project is not yet updated to then proceed to the next trial.
